    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish of wide, flat pasta sheets layered with fillings and baked. The name may come from the Latin word lasanum, which means "cooking pot", or the Greek flatbread laganon. Lasagna originated in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy in the 13th century and is considered one of the oldest pasta dishes in Italian cuisine.</p>
